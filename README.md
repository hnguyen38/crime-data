# Crime Data Application

This crime data application provides information on crimes. User inputs state abbreviation and range of years they want to see into the search form. The search form shows accumulated results in numbers for the range of years. I created this simple project for users who are looking to move or visit a specific state and want to know the crime rate. The API used for this project is from https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/docApi.
